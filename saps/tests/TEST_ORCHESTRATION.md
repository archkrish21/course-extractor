# SAPS E2E Test Suite

Single-command test gate for the SAPS v1 release. Verifies business logic, UI smoke coverage, and cross-role journeys in **~3 minutes** with **100% pass rate**.

## Run it

```bash
cd saps
npm run test:e2e:desktop
```

That's it. The command wipes auth cache, starts a production build (`next build && next start`) if not already running, and executes the full suite. Expected output: **78 passed, 0 failed, 4 skipped**.

> **First run pays a ~1-2 min build cost.** Subsequent runs reuse the running server thanks to `reuseExistingServer: true` outside CI. To skip the build between iterations, leave `npm run start` running in another terminal.

### Related commands

```bash
npm run test:e2e            # Same as test:e2e:desktop (all projects; currently desktop-only)
npm run test:e2e:ui         # Interactive Playwright inspector
npm test                    # Vitest unit tests (separate from E2E)
```

### Running a single spec

```bash
npx playwright test tests/e2e/api/gpa.spec.ts
npx playwright test tests/e2e/ui/planner.spec.ts
npx playwright test --grep "adding a course"   # by test name
```

### Playwright projects

| Project | Source | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `setup` | `auth.setup.ts` | fresh login | Creates `.auth/student.json`, `parent.json`, `counselor.json` |
| `api` | `tests/e2e/api/` | student storageState | Pure API request-context tests |
| `ui-student` | `tests/e2e/ui/` | student storageState | UI pages under student auth |
| `journeys` | `tests/e2e/journeys/` | mixed (per-file) | Role-specific flows |

The `setup` project runs first; `api`, `ui-student`, and `journeys` depend on it. Non-student journeys use per-test `test.use({ storageState })` to switch roles.

---

## Design rationale

### Why fixture-driven, not UI-driven setup

The old suite had 500+ tests with pervasive `if (noPlan) test.skip()` conditionals — which meant 30-50% of tests silently skipped based on seeded data state. The new suite uses API fixtures (`createPlan`, `addCourseToPlan`, etc.) in `beforeAll` to establish deterministic state, then asserts on UI or data. No conditional skips.

### Why single-worker serialization

The shared `student@test.com` account is subject to a 3-plan launch-tier cap. Multiple parallel workers creating scratch plans trip the cap. `workers: 1` + `fullyParallel: false` trades raw speed for determinism (still hits ~3 min since most tests are API-tier and sub-second).

### Why a production build, not `next dev`

Earlier suite runs against `next dev --turbopack` had a non-deterministic flake: under sustained sequential load, Turbopack would evict compiled API route modules from its dev cache, returning HTML 404s for routes that had already served successfully. We tried serial route warmup (PR #105, #111), helper-level retries, and Playwright `retries: 1` — each helped but none eliminated it. Production builds serve pre-compiled routes with no eviction, no lazy compile, no warmup. The class of flake is gone. Cost is a one-time ~1-2 min build per cold run.

Three small adaptations are required so the prod build can be pointed at the local Supabase emulator (only relevant for E2E and local prod previews):

- **CSP carveout** in `next.config.ts` — when `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` is `http://*` (i.e., the local emulator), it gets added to `connect-src`. Real prod uses `https://*.supabase.co` which is already wildcarded.
- **Origin header** in `playwright.config.ts` `extraHTTPHeaders` — Playwright's `APIRequestContext` doesn't send Origin by default; the prod CSRF check in `lib/api/csrf.ts` rejects mutations without one.
- **Telemetry gate** — `NEXT_PUBLIC_E2E_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1` (set only by `webServer.env`) skips `Sentry.init` and `posthog.init` so test runs don't pollute prod analytics. `next.config.ts` fails the build if this flag leaks into a Vercel production deploy.

### Why per-role storageState instead of per-test login

Every test previously spent ~3-5s logging in through the UI. Now `auth.setup.ts` runs three logins ONCE and saves cookies; tests inherit the authenticated state via storageState. Eliminated ~4 min of login overhead across the suite.

### Why `forceDeletePlan` exists

The `DELETE /api/v1/plans/:id` endpoint rejects plans that contain completed courses (transcript-integrity guard). Test scratch plans often have completed courses (GPA/waiver tests). `forceDeletePlan` flips completed→planned first, removes courses, then deletes the plan shell.

---

## Seeded test data

`global-setup.ts` establishes a deterministic baseline before every run.

### Test users (all password `Test1234!`)

| Email | Role | Grade | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `student@test.com` | student | Gr10 | Primary user; owns a seeded primary plan with 15 completed Gr9 courses |
| `student-b@test.com` | student | Gr9 | Parent's second child (multi-child switcher) |
| `parent@test.com` | parent | — | Linked to both student accounts; has edit share on primary plan |
| `counselor@test.com` | counselor | — | Linked to student's account; view share on primary plan |
| `consent-test@test.com` | student | — | No consent records (reset each run) — drives consent form tests |
| `student-onboarding@test.com` | student | — | No `onboarding_completed_at` — lets `/onboarding` render |
| `student-password@test.com` | student | — | Reserved for password-mutation tests |

### Primary plan baseline

- Named "E2E Test Plan", `is_primary = true`, `locked_grade_levels = [9]`
- 15 completed Gr9 courses with grades (A, A-, B+, B — 4 per semester × 4 semesters minus dropouts)
- Gr10 courses: 14 enrolled (2 deliberately ungraded to exercise year-end wizard)
- Parent share: `edit` permission; counselor share: `view` permission
- One `gpa_snapshots` row (cumulative 3.500 / weighted 3.750)

### Legal documents (optional)

The `consent-gate` journey test exercises the consent form UI. If `legal_documents` table is empty, the test takes a softer path (just verifies the page isn't 404'd). To exercise the full flow:

```bash
cd saps
npx tsx scripts/seed-legal-documents.ts
```

This is a one-time setup per local env.

---

## Cleanup

### Automatic, per-run

- `rm -rf tests/e2e/.auth` at the start of every `test:e2e*` command — forces auth.setup.ts to re-authenticate fresh each run
- `global-teardown.ts` after every run:
  - Deletes **all** non-primary plans owned by test users (nuclear cleanup for leftover scratch plans)
  - Belt-and-suspenders: any plan named `E2E %` or `Demo` with `is_primary = false`
  - Resets primary plan's `locked_grade_levels` to `[9]` baseline
  - Removes unclaimed invite codes from test users
  - Deletes ephemeral accounts (`student2@test.com`, `student3@test.com`) and all their data
  - Removes memberless orphan accounts

### Manual (rare — only when teardown fails)

```bash
cd saps
npx tsx scripts/cleanup-test-users.ts    # nuclear: wipes ephemeral accounts
```

| Accessibility (axe-core scans, keyboard nav, focus management) | Not in default suite | See below |

---

## Accessibility (a11y)

**Current status:** Not part of the default `test:e2e:desktop` gate.

**History:** The old suite contained `accessibility.spec.ts` with axe-core scans on login, signup, and course browser pages. It was removed during the v1 redesign because:
- Each axe scan took 5–10s, adding ~30–60s to every CI run regardless of what changed
- The scans only caught WCAG 2.0 AA violations at the component level — not keyboard focus traps, screen reader flow, or reduced-motion respect, which are the more impactful a11y concerns for this app
- The scans didn't actually block on violations — they logged to console without failing the test

**Plan for v1:**
- Manual a11y audit before launch against the [v1 scope screens](../../docs/product/) using axe DevTools, keyboard-only nav, and VoiceOver
- Document findings in `docs/security/` (or a new `docs/accessibility/`) and file tickets for P0 issues
- Add a separate `npm run test:a11y` command post-launch that runs axe scans nightly (not per-PR), covering:
  - All public pages (login, signup, homepage, terms, privacy)
  - Key authenticated pages (dashboard, planner grid, course detail modal, settings)
  - Focus traps for modals (delete account, plan share, course picker)
  - Keyboard-only course-add flow

**Why it's separate from the main gate:** axe scans are noisy (false positives on third-party components), slow, and produce findings that need human judgment to prioritize. Running them as a non-blocking nightly job catches regressions without slowing the PR loop.

**Until then:** If you're adding a new page, run axe DevTools manually in the browser and keyboard-test the happy path before merging.

## Troubleshooting

### "`test:e2e:desktop` script not found"

You're at the repo root instead of `saps/`. Run: `cd saps && npm run test:e2e:desktop`.

### Tests cascade-fail with `Plan limit reached (3)`

Leftover non-primary plans from an interrupted previous run. The teardown runs automatically at end-of-suite, but if you `Ctrl+C` mid-run, manually reset:

```bash
cd saps
npx tsx -e "
import pg from 'pg';
const c = new pg.Client({connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL});
await c.connect();
await c.query(\"DELETE FROM plan_courses WHERE plan_id IN (SELECT id FROM four_year_plans WHERE name LIKE 'E2E %' AND is_primary = false)\");
await c.query(\"DELETE FROM four_year_plans WHERE name LIKE 'E2E %' AND is_primary = false\");
await c.end();
"
```

Or just run `npm run test:e2e:desktop` again — global-teardown will clean up before the next suite finishes.

### `consent-gate` test skips

The test takes a soft path when `legal_documents` is empty. To exercise the full flow:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/seed-legal-documents.ts
```

### First run takes ~5 min instead of ~3

Playwright runs `npm run build && npm run start` for its webServer; the build adds 1-2 min on the first invocation. To skip the build on subsequent iterations, leave a server running in another terminal:

```bash
cd saps
npm run build && npm run start    # leave this running
# in another terminal:
npm run test:e2e:desktop          # reuses the running server, ~3 min
```

### Auth setup fails with "Invalid email or password" against a manually-built server

Your manual `npm run start` was built without `NEXT_PUBLIC_E2E_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1`, so Sentry inits and likely also without the Origin header set. Either let Playwright spawn the build itself, or rebuild with the env vars Playwright would have used (see `webServer.env` in `playwright.config.ts`).

### "Connecting to '127.0.0.1:54321' violates Content Security Policy" in the browser console

The CSP carveout in `next.config.ts` only fires when `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` starts with `http://`. Confirm `.env.local` has `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321` (not `https://`).

## CI

```yaml
- name: Install deps
  run: cd saps && npm ci
- name: Install Playwright browsers
  run: cd saps && npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
- name: Run E2E suite
  run: cd saps && npm run test:e2e:desktop
- name: Upload HTML report
  if: always()
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: playwright-report
    path: saps/playwright-report/
```

## Editing the suite

- Adding a new API test → drop a spec in `tests/e2e/api/`; use `helpers/api-client.ts` helpers
- Adding a new UI page test → drop a spec in `tests/e2e/ui/`; storageState auto-applies
- Adding a new role-based flow → `tests/e2e/journeys/`; use `test.use({ storageState: "./.auth/<role>.json" })` at the top
- Adding a new API endpoint helper → extend `helpers/api-client.ts` with a typed wrapper
- Always use `forceDeletePlan` in `afterAll`/`finally` for scratch plans to avoid completed-course delete blocks

## Discipline

- **After fixing a bug, add or update tests in the same PR.** A fix that ships without coverage is a fix the suite can't defend.
- **When a fix breaks an existing mock, update the mock — don't revert the fix.** The mock is the thing that's wrong if it diverges from real behavior.
- **Run E2E against the production build, not `next dev`.** This is enforced by the suite (`reuseExistingServer` only outside CI), but worth restating since dev-mode runs surface Turbopack-specific flakes that don't exist in prod.

## Philosophy

Tests should verify **behavior** (the user gets what they expect when they do X), not **existence** (the DOM has a button with text Y). If a test can pass while the feature is broken, delete it.
